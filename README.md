project name= letter soup, find my word
autor name= Juan Pablo Moya
project description: my project consist in a lettersoup, so I create a code that determines if some words are in, if they are, in a json format it returns the word with "True", otherwise would return false
How to open it? You just had to run the code, then enter to your file explorer, there it would appear a json format, open it and there would appear a dictionary with the words with it determine True or False
